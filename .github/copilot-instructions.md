Assume the development environment is a macOS machine with the following tools installed:
- Docker Desktop
- Git
- Helm
- Kind
- Kubectl
- Visual Studio Code

For any instructions, assume that a script or code should be created/updated.

Ensure any scripts can be run multiple times without errors.

Use 2 spaces for tabs.

Prefer deploying to Kubernetes clusters using helm rather than kustomize.
